# Contrary to what most people on the Internet believe, modern Linux
# distributions handle setting the default umask for an user via the
# pam_umask module, outside of /etc/profile, /etc/profile.d/*,
# ~/.profile or other similar application-specific configuration files.
# As pam_umask(8) states, and the comments at the default /etc/login.defs
# and /etc/pam.d/common-session files of a stock Debian/Ubuntu describe, the
# correct way to set a default umask for all users is to change
# /etc/login.defs. Debian/Ubuntu's pam_umask is built with usergroups on by
# default, so the mask group bits are set to match the user bits if user name =
# group name and uid != 0. The default value is 022: allow others to read
# files and traverse folders by default, but disallow others in the group
# from modifying files.
#
# A 0007 umask shares files with other users in the same group even if the main
# group name does not match the user name, and disallows sharing stuff with
# others, which is safer. It also applies to SFTP logins, as SSH integrates
# with the PAM subsystem
