# megacmd

Custom MEGAcmd AArch64/ARM64 binary Debian package for Ubuntu Noble (24.04 LTS),
generated by cross-compiling from a Ubuntu Noble x64 Docker container.

This custom build is necessary because Mega [does not officially distribute
ARM64 binary packages for this
distribution](https://github.com/meganz/MEGAcmd/issues/698).

## Getting started

Make sure that Docker is installed and working, and then run `build.sh` on this
directory. If everything goes fine, the script will generate a throwaway
container, output a `megacmd_arm64.deb` file to this directory, and clean up its
temporary image.
